# Optimizing a ML model pipeline in Azure

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. 
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Hyperdrive for parameter tuning in Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. 
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

# Dataset

The dataset is a bank marketing dataset including personal information for marketing campaigns.
The data includes details such as age, marital status, job, etc. of the individuals.

# Summary of the models
